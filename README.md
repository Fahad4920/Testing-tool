# Package Dimension Finder

##  Project Description
This project calculates the **dimensions of a package** based on the size of an item entered by the user.  
It helps in estimating packaging requirements and shipping dimensions automatically.
---

## How It Works
1. The user enters the **length, width, and height** of an item.  
2. The program applies a small buffer value (extra space) to determine the appropriate **package dimensions**.  
3. The calculated package dimensions are displayed as the final result.

### Example Formula:
```
package_length = item_length + 2
package_width  = item_width + 2
package_height = item_height + 2
```

---

## 💻 Usage
Run the program using any Python/JavaScript/Java environment (depending on your code language).  

### Example (Python version)
```python
length = float(input("Enter item length: "))
width = float(input("Enter item width: "))
height = float(input("Enter item height: "))

package_length = length + 2
package_width = width + 2
package_height = height + 2

print(f"Recommended package dimensions: {package_length} x {package_width} x {package_height}")
```
